    "This notebook was prepared by Taylor Hixson (taylor.hixson@nyu.edu) for the NYUAD Library workshop Introduction to Data Visualization with Python offered on 3 November 2019. This workshop shows the basics of using seaborn to create basic static visualizations for publication. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python library that is built on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). While Matplotlib offers great flexibility and customization (e.g. creating functions to automate figures), seaborn has a simpler syntax and visually attractive default style options. \n",
